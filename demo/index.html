        <div class="text">The legendary great white shark is far more fearsome in our imaginations than in reality. As scientific research
          on these elusive predators increases, their image as mindless killing machines is beginning to fade. Of the 100-plus
          annual shark attacks worldwide, fully one-third to one-half are attributable to great whites. However, most of
          these are not fatal, and new research finds that great whites, who are naturally curious, are "sample biting" then
          releasing their victims rather than preying on humans. It's not a terribly comforting distinction, but it does
          indicate that humans are not actually on the great white's menu. Great whites are the largest predatory fish on
          Earth. They grow to an average of 15 feet in length, though specimens exceeding 20 feet and weighing up to 5,000
          pounds have been recorded. They have slate-gray upper bodies to blend in with the rocky coastal sea floor, but
          get their name from their universally white underbellies. They are streamlined, torpedo-shaped swimmers with powerful
          tails that can propel them through the water at speeds of up to 15 miles per hour. They can even leave the water
          completely, breaching like whales when attacking prey from underneath.</div>

          mainly on juveniles. As these sharks mature, the lines begin to fade and almost disappear. Shark Attacks These
          large, blunt-nosed predators have a duly earned reputation as man-eaters. They are second only to great whites
          in attacking people. But because they have a near completely undiscerning palate, they are not likely to swim away
          after biting a human, as great whites frequently do. They are consummate scavengers, with excellent senses of sight
          and smell and a nearly limitless menu of diet items.</div>

        <div class="text">This shark's unusual name comes from the unusual shape of its head, an amazing piece of anatomy built to maximize
          the fish's ability to find its favorite meal: stingrays. A hammerhead shark uses its wide head to trap stingrays
          by pinning them to the seafloor. The shark's eye placement, on each end of its very wide head, allows it to scan
          more area more quickly than other sharks can. The hammerhead also has special sensors across its head that helps
          it scan for food in the ocean. Living creatures' bodies give off electrical signals, which are picked up by sensors
          on the prowling hammerhead. The shark hunts alone, and can find stingrays that hide under the sand on the seafloor.
          Hammerheads also eat bony fishes, crabs, squid, lobsters, and other sea creatures. The upper sides of these fish
          are grayish-brown or olive-green and they have white bellies. They have very impressive triangular, serrated teethâ€”like
          the edge of a saw's blade. Hammerheads' mouths are on the underside of their heads.</div>
